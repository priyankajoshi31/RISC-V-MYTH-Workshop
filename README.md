# RISC-V MYTH Workshop- Building a RISC-V core using TL-Verilog
The study of a basic RISC-V ISA and the implementation of a simple RISC-V core with base instruction set have been covered in the 5-day MYTH (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours) Workshop on RISC V based CPU Core Design organized by VLSI System Design (VSD) & Redwood EDA. The programming languages employed in the software section are C, Assembly Language, and some pseudo codes. 
The RISC-V CPU core has been designed with the aid of Transaction Level Verilog (TL-Verilog) along with the Makerchip IDE platform. All the information regarding this workshop has been incorporated into this repository as below. Tools used: Spike and Makerchip IDE.

## Introduction to RISC V
RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, the RISC-V ISA is provided under open source licenses.Notable features of the RISC-V ISA include a loadâ€“store architecture, bit patterns to simplify the multiplexers in a CPU, IEEE 754 floating-point, and placing most-significant bits at a fixed location to speed sign extension. The instruction set is designed for a wide range of uses. It is variable-width and extensible so that more encoding bits can always be added. It supports three word-widths, 32, 64, and 128 bits, and a variety of subsets.

### Advantage of RISC-V over ARM and X86 :

* RISC-V is open-source, there is no need to pay for the IP.
* RISC-V is far smaller than other commercial ISAs.
* RISC-V has a small standard base ISA, with multiple standard extensions.
* Base and first standard extensions are already frozen. There is no need to worry about major updates.
* Specific functions can be added based on extensions. There are many more extensions are under development, such as Vector.

### Makerchip Platform
Makerchip developed by Redwood EDA is a free online environment for developing high-quality integrated circuits. This platform can code, compile, simulate and debug Verilog designs from a browser and the code, block diagram and waveform are tightly integrated. It supports Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog), in addition to Verilog and synthesizable SystemVerilog.


### TL-Verilog
Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog) is an emerging extension to SystemVerilog that supports a new design methodology, called transaction-level design. In this project design TL-Verilog has been chosed as the HDL of choice with Makerchip IDE. Transaction Level Verilog standard is an extension of Verilog having advantages like simpler syntax, shorter code length and easy pipelining which results in less execution time. The main advantage of TL-Verilog over System Verilog is the code length reduction.

Timing abstract can be done in TL-Verilog, which is specified by pipelines in which the sequential elements are generated by tools from the pipelined specification. This allows for easy retiming without the risk of introduction of any functional bugs.

## DAY-1 Instruction Set Architecture & GNU Toolchain.

 
### Contents
1. Introduction to RISC-V basic keywords
2. Labwork for RISC-V software toolchain
3. Integer number representation
4. Signed and unsigned arithmetic operations

The workshop began with the brief introductory session about the flow we would be following in making RISC-V CPU Core by @Kunalghosh and @Stevehoover.We were made familiar with the VSD-IAT platform and the lab instances we will be using for the design.

A brief overview of how the higher level languages are converted into assembly language followed by conversion into machine/binary format, and finally how it gets converted into a chip layout was explained by @Kunalghosh. We were introduced to RISC-V ISA and GNU Compiler Toolchain as well as with various types of RISC-V instructions sets, such as:

* **RV64I or RV32I Base integer instructions**: 64 and 32 bit data instructions respectively
* **RV64M**: Multiply extension
* **RV64IM**: Includes base and multiple extension.
* **RV64F and RV64D**: Floating point and Double extenstion.

Additionally we learnt about the signed and unsigned integer number representation and their maximum and minimum ranges for a 64bit instruction set.

### Integer:
* **Word**: 32 bits.
* **Double word**: 64 bits
RV64 range = 0 to (264 - 1)

* **Negative i.e signed numbers**:
Range = -263 to (263 - 1)

The instructions which work on these numbers are called Base Integer Instruction RV64I.

A CPU core implementing all the above type of instrcutions is called as **RV64IMFD CPU Core**.

# Lab Exercises

### Lab 1 : C program for the Sum of numbers from 1 to n
A basic C program to calculate sum of natural numbers upto a limit provided by the user. The code can be found here

### Commands used for compiling using GNU toolchain
1. Open a file named sum_1_to_n. using leafpad editor. `$leafpad sum_1_to_n.c`
2. Write your C code for sum of numbers from 1 to n (here n =9).
3. Compile using GNU compiler. `$gcc sum_1_to_n.c`
4. Run the compiled object file (Default object file formed with the name a.out). $./a/out

### Lab 2 : Sum of 1 to n using RISC-V compiler toolchain.
The C program for sum of 1 to n is now compiled using RISC-V toolchain. Spike simulator is used to run the object file , as well as a debugger.

### Commands for compiling using RISC-V simulator
1. To run the previously created program of sum_1_to_n.c program  using RISC-V simulator: `$riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_1_to_n.o sum_1_to_n.c`

2. To check the assembly code for the C program that we are running,i.e to see the disassembled file, we run the following in a new tab in the terminal: `$riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum_1_to_n.o | less`

3. Type \main when the objdump file opens.
### Objdump file using -Ofast:
### Objdump file usinf -O1:

4. For running the object file compiled by RISC-V compiler, we are using the spike simulator. `$spike pk sum_1_to_n.o`
For debugging using RISC-V simulator
In order to debug all the assembly set instructions, we do it with the spike debugger.

$spike -d pk sum_1_to_n.o

In a parallel new tab in the terminal, we open the objdump file , and look out for the address location of the pc (say for main program or any part of the program that we want).

After the spike debugger opens, type :

:until pc 0 100b0 , where 100b0 is the address location from where we start debugging.

:reg 0 a0 , To see the contents of the register a0.

Press enter to execute the next set of assembly code instructions.
Lab 3 : To find the Max and Min unsigned and signed number representations.
A C program is implemented to show the maximum and minimum unsigned and signed number representations for a RV64I instruction. The code can be found here

Commands used are same as Lab 2
Final Output Results for Day_1 of the Workshop
Sum of numbers from 1 to n (n=9).
To find the maximum and minimumm number that can be represented using 64-bit unnsigned and signed integer number reperesentation.
