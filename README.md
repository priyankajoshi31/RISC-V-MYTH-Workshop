# RISC-V MYTH Workshop- Building a RISC-V core using TL-Verilog
The study of a basic RISC-V ISA and the implementation of a simple RISC-V core with base instruction set have been covered in the 5-day MYTH (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours) Workshop on RISC V based CPU Core Design organized by VLSI System Design (VSD) & Redwood EDA. The programming languages employed in the software section are C, Assembly Language, and some pseudo codes. 
The RISC-V CPU core has been designed with the aid of Transaction Level Verilog (TL-Verilog) along with the Makerchip IDE platform. All the information regarding this workshop has been incorporated into this repository as below. Tools used: Spike and Makerchip IDE.

## Introduction to RISC V
RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, the RISC-V ISA is provided under open source licenses.Notable features of the RISC-V ISA include a loadâ€“store architecture, bit patterns to simplify the multiplexers in a CPU, IEEE 754 floating-point, and placing most-significant bits at a fixed location to speed sign extension. The instruction set is designed for a wide range of uses. It is variable-width and extensible so that more encoding bits can always be added. It supports three word-widths, 32, 64, and 128 bits, and a variety of subsets.

### Advantage of RISC-V over ARM and X86 :

* RISC-V is open-source, there is no need to pay for the IP.
* RISC-V is far smaller than other commercial ISAs.
* RISC-V has a small standard base ISA, with multiple standard extensions.
* Base and first standard extensions are already frozen. There is no need to worry about major updates.
* Specific functions can be added based on extensions. There are many more extensions are under development, such as Vector.

## Makerchip Platform
Makerchip is a free online environment by Redwood EDA for developing high-quality integrated circuits. The online platform can be used to code, compile, simulate and debug Verilog designs from a browser. It gives you a place to create any digital sequential logic you can dream up faster than you ever thought was possible, all within your browser. The breakthrough in productivity is two fold:

A tight integration of design, simulation, and debug capabilities
Support for Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog), in addition to Verilog and synthesizable SystemVerilog.

TL-Verilog
Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog) is an emerging extension to SystemVerilog that supports a new design methodology, called transaction-level design. For this project, TL-Verilog has been chosed as the HDL of choice for the design. Projects on Makerchip can be completely designed using TL-Verilog. Transaction Level Verilog standard is an extension of Verilog which has various advantages like simpler syntax, shorter codes and easy pipelining. Tha main advantage of TL-Verilog over System Verilog is the amount of code reduction in designing even a simple model.

Timing abstract can be done in TL-Verilog. This model is specified for pipelines where the sequential elements are generated by tools from the pipelined specification. This allows for easy retiming without the risk of introduction of any functional bugs. More information on timing abstract in TL-Verilog can be found in the IEEE paper "Timing-Abstract Circuit Design in Transaction-Level Verilog" by Steven Hoover".
